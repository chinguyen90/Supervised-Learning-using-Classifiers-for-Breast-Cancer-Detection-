# Supervised Learning using Classifiers for Breast Cancer Detection

•	Worked on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset to detect whether a biopsy is cancerous or non-cancerous so that early treatment could be provided
•	Developed 4 classifiers: Nearest Neighbors, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Neural Network
•	Measured the performance of each model and compared the accuracy rate to find the best model
